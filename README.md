# Blocktank Worker 
This module is the base class that all microservice workers in Blocktank use.


## Development

- Build: `npm run build`
- Test: `npm run test`. The [vscode jest](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-jest) extension is very convenient to selectively run tests.
